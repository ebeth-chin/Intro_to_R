This is the setup guidelines for the Intro to R session for the Kable/Lemay Co-Op lab meeting on Friday, 09/27/2019.  

# Setup R and RStudio

Follow the instructions from [here](https://cengel.github.io/R-intro/) to download R and RStudio, and to check for any updates. Make sure you download the *FREE* version of RStudio (RStudio Desktop). 

# Download the data

We'll be working with an example ASA24-2016 dataset, which I've provided in the /data/ folder.
We'll be working with the specific file: Snow_2018-05-30_42236_Items.csv.   


I suggest to make a folder (a.k.a. 'directory') dedicated to this session. You can save this file, the data files, and the teaching notes to that same directory. It's important that you know where the directory with the data 'lives' on your computer, because you'll need to tell RStudio where it is when we are ready to use the data. 

You can download the data directly from the [ASA24 researcher website.](https://epi.grants.cancer.gov/asa24/researcher/sample.html) if you want. This will contain data from other versions of ASA24. Be sure to download this file: "Sample Analysis Files and Data Dictionaries for ASA24-2016, ASA24-Canada-2016, and ASA24-Australia-2016". 


Stay tuned for the teaching notes. Feel free to contact Elizabeth at elichin@ucdavis.edu if you need any help with setup!
