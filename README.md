# Intro to R 

Welcome to the repo for the Lemay Lab Intro to R sessions!  

The notebooks are available in .R and .Rmd file formats, with a .html output counterpart. If you download (clone) this repo, you can use the .R file to practice using R in the vanilla R format, or practice using R markdown using the .Rmd file. The .html is just a pretty version of the Rmd file that you can use as notes.    

Test your knowledge using the files that say "no_solutions" and check your answers using the files "with_solutions".      

You can view the HTML files without downloading the repo by clicking here:
