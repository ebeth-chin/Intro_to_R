# Intro to R 

Welcome to the repo for the Lemay Lab Intro to R sessions!  

The notebooks are available in .R and .Rmd file formats, with a .html output counterpart. If you download (clone) this repo, you can use the .R file to practice using R in the vanilla R format, or practice using R markdown using the .Rmd file. The .html is just a pretty version of the Rmd file that you can use as notes.
